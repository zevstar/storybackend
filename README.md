# storybackend

# The web app will be a program that parents can use to create a personalized birth story for their kid.
# The API will have two tables: one for the cast of characters, and one for the story.
# Users will be able to add/delete/edit info about their kid's family structure.
# Two endpoints: "api/v1/alltitles" which will return all the story titles, and "api/v1/allchildnames" which will return all the names of the children.
# -- Other endpoints may be added or substituted as needed.
# The stories will be customizable within categories depending on the family structure.
